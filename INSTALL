=== How to configure emu8051 for kb9012 and make/install it ===

These instructions are for Ubuntu Linux, but they would be
similar for other distributions.

1) Install all the dependencies:

sudo apt-get install autoconf libtool automake pkg-config
libreadline-dev libglib2.0-dev flex bison gawk gtk+-2.0

Gawk and gtk+-2.0 could be optional, though...

2) as504 or ASEM-51 ?

If you would try to follow the next steps right now,
skipping this, you would get a following warning:

configure: WARNING: Please install as504
(http://www.vanwal.nl/as504/) or ASEM-51 (http://plit.de/asem-51)
to run test suite.

Although ASEM-51 is newer, it seems to be closed source
(cannot find the source code for Linux version) If it is true,
it is better to get as504, and here are the instructions how:

*) Download: http://www.vanwal.nl/as504/as504_20050519.tar.bz2
*) Extract it: cd ~/Downloads && tar xvjf ./as504_20050519.tar.bz2
*) Run the following command:

make && sudo cp ./as504/ /usr/bin/as504

3) Now, cd back to emu8051 directory, and run:

./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-kb9012
make && sudo make install
